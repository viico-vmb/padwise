# PadWise — Mousepad Finder

**PadWise** is a **gamer-first mousepad recommender** that gives you a clean shortlist in **~60 seconds**.

No hype, no “one pad fits all”. Just tradeoffs (control vs speed, humidity, durability) + a ranked result with **human reasons**.

**Live demo:** https://padwise-blush.vercel.app

## Why this exists

Choosing a pad is annoying:
- some pads turn **muddy in humidity**
- “control” vs “speed” is vague without context
- your **game + sens** changes what “good” means

PadWise solves that with a small quiz + a simple scoring system you can read and modify.

## What you get

- ✅ 6-question quiz (local, instant)
- ✅ ranked recommendations (top picks + **why**)
- ✅ starter dataset (**30 popular pads**)
- ✅ privacy-first (client-side, no accounts, no tracking)
- ✅ dark UI (product-style)

> Neutral tool. No brand affiliation. Always verify exact specs/availability before buying.
